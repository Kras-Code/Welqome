                        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal data we process:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                when our AI receptionists or other agents interact with you on calls, via messaging channels
                                or similar interfaces;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                when we provide Services to our customers, including CRM or telephony integrations; and

                            <li>

                            It does not govern the privacy practices of our customers. Where you interact with a WelQome agent
                            representing a particular business, that business will typically be the primary controller of your
                            data for that interaction and will have its own privacy notice.

                        <p>Depending on context, we may process personal data as:</p>

                        <h3>Independent Controller</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For Website usage and analytics.</li>
                            <li>For our own CRM, sales, marketing and account management.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Processor (or sub-processor)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When we host, route, transcribe or analyse calls and messages on behalf of our customers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When we integrate with customers’ systems (e.g. telephony, CRM, calendars, ticketing,
                                messaging platforms) and process personal data solely under their instructions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            In processor scenarios, our customers are responsible for providing a compliant privacy notice to
                            callers and other end-users, and we process data strictly in line with our contracts and their
                            documented instructions.

                        <h2>4. Categories of personal data we collect</h2>

                        <p>
                            The precise data we process depends on how you interact with us and which Services are in use.
                            Typically we may collect:
                        </p>

                        <h3>Identity and contact data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Name, title, role, employer, contact details (email address, telephone number, business address).
                            Account identifiers and login details (if you use a WelQome account or portal).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Business and contract data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Organisation name, billing details, contract documents, commercial correspondence and
                            transaction history.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Call and interaction data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Caller ID, phone number, call routing information and timestamps. Audio recordings of calls
                            handled by WelQome agents (where enabled). Transcripts and conversation summaries generated by
                            speech recognition and natural language processing tools. Interaction logs (e.g. which prompts
                            were used, which actions were taken on your behalf, outcomes of calls).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Technical and usage data</h3>
                        <p>
                            IP address, device identifiers, browser type and version, time zone setting and approximate
                            location, operating system, referrer URLs. Clickstream data, pages visited, time spent on
                            pages, interaction with UI elements, and log files generated by our systems. Telemetry required
                            for monitoring system performance and security (e.g. request metadata, error logs).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Marketing and communication preference data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Preferences regarding marketing communications, channels and content. Records of consents and
                            opt-outs.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Recruitment data (if you apply for a role)</h3>
                        <p>
                            CV, cover letter, qualifications, work history, interview notes, assessment results and
                            references.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Special category data (sensitive data)</h3>
                        <p>
                            In principle, we do not intentionally seek to collect health data, racial or ethnic origin
                            information, religious beliefs, or other special category data via our Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, our agents may incidentally process such data if you disclose it during a call,
                            message or form submission. Where this occurs, we will process it only as necessary to fulfil the
                            purpose of the interaction (e.g. scheduling a medical appointment) and in line with applicable
                            legal bases and safeguards.

                            the relevant retention period expires, we will securely delete or anonymise the data.

                        <p>
                            WelQome’s Services involve automated processing (including AI and natural language processing) to
                            understand and respond to callers, route calls, collect information and perform defined actions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In typical use, these automated processes do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on
                            individuals in the sense defined by UK GDPR.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Where any deployment could involve solely automated decision-making producing such effects, we will
                            ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and that affected individuals are informed of the
                            logic involved, the significance and envisaged consequences, and their rights to obtain human
                            intervention, express their point of view and contest the decision.
